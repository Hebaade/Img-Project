function varargout = Gui(varargin)
% TRYINGGUI MATLAB code for tryingGui.fig
%      TRYINGGUI, by itself, creates a new TRYINGGUI or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = TRYINGGUI returns the handle to a new TRYINGGUI or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      TRYINGGUI('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in TRYINGGUI.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      TRYINGGUI('Property','Value',...) creates a new TRYINGGUI or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before tryingGui_OpeningFcn gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to tryingGui_OpeningFcn via varargin.
%
%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
